    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        My name is <strong>Joe</strong> and I am a <strong>Web Developer</strong>
        from Kansas City.
        I started this blog to document my journey in learning different technologies.
        The best way I learn is through research, projects, and mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey started in Banking and Finance.  In 2013, I decided to switch career
        paths and pursue a career in Web Development.  It wasn't easy for me and it is still
        a challenge, but I am stubborn and I do not give up easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently working as a <strong>Python Developer</strong> with a primary focus on
        <strong>Web Development (Django), Databases, and tkinter</strong>.  I hope the projects
        I document and my blog posts will help you in your journey.
